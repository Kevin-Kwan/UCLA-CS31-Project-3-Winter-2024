# UCLA CS31 Winter 2024 Programming Assignment/Project 3 Implementation

## Results

I currently don't have the ability to run the test cases on my code yet. Check back at another time to see how I scored.

## Disclaimer

This was written in a rush in about an hour.

This is my own modified implementation of the assignment for the purpose of self-learning C++ and practicing C++ programming.

I am not responsible for any mistakes or errors in this program.

## About

This repository contains a C++ application that that validates and analyzes string QC test results. The application checks if a QC result string is valid, calculates the total number of tests, passes, defects, and batches, and handles errors appropriately.

## Contribution

Feel free to open any issues if you believe there is a mistake regarding the behavior of this program.
